Take a prototype and code it into a website and make it responsive.
Peer reviewed by: Jovann: Everything looks great on desktop looks like the protoype all links go to the right section of the page. I like the nave bar turns throws a drop down the smaller it gets. There is a little bit of responsiveness but the smaller I get the background image shrinks but the cards and text and all that do not thats the main issue I see. Other then that the desktop view looked awesome for first time re creating a website.
